543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Easy

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.diameter = 0
    
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.maxDepth(root)
        return self.diameter
    
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        l = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        r = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        cur_D = l + r
        if cur_D > self.diameter:
            self.diameter = cur_D
        return max(l, r) + 1
